        <h2>Hey! Thanks so much for checking out Street Typer X!</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>What is Street Typer X?</h3>
        <p>Glad you asked. This is just a site for anyone to help practice their typing skills. It may be limited right now, but I'm sure that it will have more functionality in the future.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why do I care?</h3>
        <p>Well, typing speed's really important. We live in a digital world. Every day, you type on a keyboard, possibly for many hours. The difference between 40 WPM, the average, and 80 WPM is staggering. It's double!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How'd you make this?</h3>
        <p>I used Nuxt.js to make this site. This is my first time using it so you might see some similarities to the Nuxt template. It's great and allows me to skip making a bunch of boilerplate stuff.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Can I contact you/see your other projects?</h3>
        <p>Sure thing! You can check me out on <a href="https://github.com/gitxWafl" target="_blank">Github</a> or on Discord (ImperialWater#2125).</p>
